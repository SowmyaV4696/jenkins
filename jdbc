To downgrade the jdbc plugin version from 5.4.1 to 5.4.0 while keeping your Logstash version as 8.6.2, you can follow these steps:

Stop your Logstash instance if it's currently running.
Navigate to the Logstash installation directory on your system.
Locate the Gemfile.lock file in the logstash-8.6.2 directory.
Open the Gemfile.lock file in a text editor.
Search for the jdbc entry in the file. It should look something like this:
scss
Copy code
jdbc (5.4.1)
  logstash-mixin-configuration (>= 0)
  sequel (~> 5.39)
Change the version number from 5.4.1 to 5.4.0, like this:
scss
Copy code
jdbc (5.4.0)
  logstash-mixin-configuration (>= 0)
  sequel (~> 5.39)
Save the Gemfile.lock file.
Delete the Gemfile.lock file.
Open a terminal or command prompt window.
Navigate to the logstash-8.6.2 directory.
Run the following command to install the new version of the jdbc plugin:
python
Copy code
bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-input-jdbc -v 5.4.0
Start your Logstash instance.
After following these steps, your Logstash instance should be running with the jdbc plugin version of 5.4.0.
